Adding labels to your alert configuration helps provide context and metadata that can be used for better alert routing, grouping, and filtering. Here are some useful labels you can consider adding to your Prometheus alert rules:

1. **`severity`**: Indicates the importance of the alert, such as `critical`, `warning`, `info`, etc.

2. **`alert_type`**: Specifies the type of alert, like `resource_usage`, `performance`, `availability`, `security`, etc.

3. **`resource`**: Indicates the resource involved, such as `cpu`, `memory`, `disk`, `network`, etc.

4. **`job`**: Denotes the job or service name from which the alert originates (inherited from Prometheus metrics, such as `node_exporter`, `api_server`).

5. **`instance`**: Represents the specific instance (server) where the alert is firing, like `server1.example.com`.

6. **`environment`**: Specifies the environment in which the alert occurs, such as `production`, `staging`, `development`.

7. **`region`**: Indicates the geographical region, such as `us-east-1`, `eu-west-1`, etc., useful for multi-region monitoring.

8. **`datacenter`**: Specifies the data center where the instance is hosted, e.g., `dc1`, `dc2`, `dc3`.

9. **`service`**: Denotes the specific service or application generating the alert, like `database`, `webserver`, `cache`.

10. **`team`**: Specifies the responsible team, such as `ops`, `dev`, `networking`, allowing alerts to be routed to specific teams.

11. **`priority`**: Helps indicate urgency, using levels such as `P1`, `P2`, `P3`.

12. **`sla`**: Indicates the Service Level Agreement (SLA) associated with the alert, which can help prioritize based on SLA requirements.

13. **`owner`**: Specifies the individual or team responsible for the resource, useful for routing alerts to the correct owner.

14. **`cluster`**: Helps in multi-cluster environments to identify which cluster the alert is related to.

15. **`component`**: Represents a specific component of an application or infrastructure, such as `frontend`, `backend`, `database`.

16. **`impact`**: Describes the impact level of the alert, e.g., `high`, `medium`, `low`, useful for prioritizing alerts.

17. **`customer`**: Indicates a specific customer or tenant, useful in multi-tenant environments for filtering and alert management.

18. **`function`**: Represents the specific function within the service, such as `authentication`, `logging`, `api_gateway`.

19. **`mode`**: Describes the operational mode of the alert, e.g., `primary`, `replica`, `standby`, useful in clustered or HA systems.

20. **`cause`**: Indicates a known cause for the alert if identifiable, e.g., `network_issue`, `hardware_failure`, `high_traffic`, to provide context.

### Example Usage with New Labels

Hereâ€™s how you could incorporate some of these labels in an alert rule:

```yaml
- alert: HighMemoryUsage
  expr: (node_memory_MemTotal_bytes - node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes) / node_memory_MemTotal_bytes * 100 > 90
  for: 2m
  labels:
    severity: warning
    alert_type: resource_usage
    resource: memory
    environment: production
    region: us-east-1
    team: ops
    priority: P2
  annotations:
    summary: "High Memory Usage Detected on {{ $labels.instance }}"
    description: "Memory usage is above 90% for more than 2 minutes on instance {{ $labels.instance }} in the {{ $labels.environment }} environment (job: {{ $labels.job }})."
``` 

Adding such labels will provide better context in the alert details, making it easier to route, filter, and analyze alerts.
