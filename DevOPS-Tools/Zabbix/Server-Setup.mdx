### Guide to Set Up Zabbix Monitoring Tool Server Using Docker Compose

This guide will help you set up a Zabbix monitoring tool server using Docker Compose by cloning the official Zabbix Docker repository.

### Prerequisites

1. **Docker and Docker Compose**: Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Clone the Official Zabbix Docker Repository**:
   Clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zabbix/zabbix-docker.git
   cd zabbix-docker
   ```



2. **Customize Environment Variables**:
   If needed, you can customize the `.env` file to change default settings. For now, we'll proceed with the defaults.

3. **Start the Zabbix Containers**:
   Run Docker Compose to start all the Zabbix services.
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Verify the Containers Are Running**:
   Check the status of the containers to ensure everything is up and running.
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```

5. **Access the Zabbix Web Interface**:
   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`. You should see the Zabbix setup screen.

6. **Finish Zabbix Setup**:
   Follow the setup instructions on the web interface:
   - **Database type**: MySQL
   - **Database host**: mysql
   - **Database port**: 3306
   - **Database name**: zabbix
   - **User**: zabbix
   - **Password**: zabbix

   Leave the rest of the settings as default.

7. **Login to Zabbix**:
   After completing the setup, log in to the Zabbix web interface using the default credentials:
   - **Username**: Admin
   - **Password**: zabbix

### Additional Configuration

1. **Secure Your Database**:
   Change the default database passwords in the `.env` file and ensure the passwords are secure.

2. **Backup Data**:
   Regularly back up the volumes used by the containers to avoid data loss.

3. **Monitor Other Hosts**:
   Add other hosts and configure monitoring for them within the Zabbix web interface.

4. **Set Up Alerts and Notifications**:
   Configure Zabbix to send alerts and notifications based on your monitoring needs.

### Conclusion

> By following this guide, you should have a fully functional Zabbix monitoring tool server running with Docker Compose using the official Zabbix Docker repository. This setup provides a scalable and easily maintainable monitoring solution.
