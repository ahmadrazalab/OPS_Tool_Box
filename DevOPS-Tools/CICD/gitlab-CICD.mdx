## Basic CI/CD Pipeline Example
This document provides examples of CI/CD pipeline configurations for automating testing, building, and deploying applications. 

### `.gitlab-ci.yml`

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build-job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Compiling the code... 🛠️"
    - echo "Compile complete. ✅"

unit-test-job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Running unit tests... This will take about 60 seconds. 🧪"
    - sleep 60
    - echo "Code coverage is 90% 📊"

lint-test-job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Linting code... This will take about 10 seconds. 🔍"
    - sleep 10
    - echo "No lint issues found. 🧹"

deploy-job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying application... 🚀"
    - echo "Application successfully deployed. 🎉"
    - echo "Completed... ✅"
```

### Explanation

1. **Variables**: 
   - `IMAGE_NAME` and `IMAGE_TAG` are defined to specify the Docker image name and tag.

2. **Stages**:
   - `test`: Runs tests to ensure the code is working correctly.
   - `build`: Builds the Docker image.
   - `deploy`: Deploys the application to a server.

3. **Jobs**:
   - `run_tests`: Uses Python image, installs `make`, and runs tests.
   - `build_image`: Uses Docker-in-Docker to build and push Docker images.
   - `deploy`: Uses SSH to connect to the server, remove old containers, and run the new Docker container.

### Additional Examples

- **Build Job**: Compiles the code.
- **Unit Test Job**: Runs unit tests and checks code coverage.
- **Lint Test Job**: Checks the code for linting issues.
- **Deploy Job**: Deploys the application if all tests pass.
