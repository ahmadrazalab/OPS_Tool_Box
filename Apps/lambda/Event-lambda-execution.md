### ðŸ“„ Steps to Schedule Daily Execution of a Lambda Function

#### Step 1: Create or Identify the Lambda Function
If you havenâ€™t created the Lambda function yet, create one in the AWS Lambda console. If you already have a Lambda function that you want to run daily, note down its **ARN** (Amazon Resource Name).

#### Step 2: Set Up a CloudWatch Events Rule

1. Go to the **Amazon EventBridge** console (previously CloudWatch Events) in your AWS Management Console.
2. Click on **Rules** from the left sidebar, then click **Create rule**.

#### Step 3: Configure the Schedule Rule

1. **Name** your rule (e.g., `DailyLambdaTrigger`).
2. **Define pattern:** Select **Event Source** as **Schedule**.
3. In the **Fixed rate or Cron expression** section, choose **Cron expression**.

   - Use the following cron expression to trigger the function at 12:00 AM UTC daily:

     ```
     cron(0 0 * * ? *)
     ```

   - Explanation of the cron format:  
     ```
     cron(Minutes Hours Day-of-month Month Day-of-week Year)
     ```
     - `0 0 * * ? *` means it will run every day at 00:00 UTC.

4. Click **Next**.

#### Step 4: Add Target

1. In the **Target** section, select **Lambda function**.
2. From the **Function** dropdown, choose the Lambda function you want to trigger.
3. (Optional) You can add custom input to the Lambda if your function requires specific parameters.
4. Click **Next**, then review the rule.

#### Step 5: Create the Rule

1. Review the configuration, ensuring everything looks good, then click **Create rule**.

### ðŸ“ˆ Testing and Verifying the Schedule
To confirm the schedule is working, you can manually trigger the Lambda function from the **Lambda Console** or wait until the scheduled time (12:00 AM UTC). You can also check for logs in **Amazon CloudWatch Logs** to see if the Lambda function executes successfully.

> Using a CloudWatch Events rule (EventBridge), you can schedule your Lambda function to run at a specified time each day without needing any additional infrastructure or manual intervention.
