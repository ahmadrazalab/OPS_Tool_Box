# Static Database Deployment on Kubernetes

This project demonstrates how to deploy a static database in a Kubernetes cluster using Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) to maintain data persistence. This setup can be used to run stateful applications where data needs to be preserved beyond the lifecycle of individual pods.

## Overview

The setup includes:
- **Database Deployment**: Runs the database instance as a Kubernetes deployment.
- **Persistent Volume (PV)**: Provides storage at the cluster level.
- **Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)**: Requests specific storage from the Persistent Volume to ensure data is retained.
- **Service**: Exposes the database within the cluster to allow other applications to connect to it.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Minikube, EKS, GKE, or AKS).
- `kubectl` CLI tool.
- Basic knowledge of Kubernetes objects like Deployments, PVs, PVCs, and Services.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Apply the Persistent Volume and Persistent Volume Claim:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f db-pv.yaml
   kubectl apply -f db-pvc.yaml
   ```

3. Deploy the database:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f db-deployment.yaml
   ```

4. Expose the database as a Service:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f db-service.yaml
   ```

## File Structure

- **db-pv.yaml**: Defines the Persistent Volume.
- **db-pvc.yaml**: Defines the Persistent Volume Claim.
- **db-deployment.yaml**: Defines the Deployment for the database.
- **db-service.yaml**: Defines the Service to expose the database within the cluster.

## Usage

After deployment, the database can be accessed within the Kubernetes cluster through the defined service. The data stored in the database will persist even if the database pod is restarted or redeployed.
